This is my Web Design end-of-course final project.
We were instructed to program a website about our favorite movie using HTML5 and CSS3.
I created a website for Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.
The website includes parallax images, multiple pages, interactive buttons, and an embedded youtube video.
